scheme
======
Data model and persistence for the P&ID process scheme.

A scheme is a directed graph of typed nodes (equipment / sources / sinks)
connected by edges with explicit input/output ports.

The simulation engine walks this graph instead of using a hardcoded
equipment sequence, so the operator can build and connect new objects
on the frontend and the digital twin simulates the resulting topology.
